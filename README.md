# Video2SRT
Video2SRT is a tool that uses WebAssembly to transcribe video and audio files locally on your machine. The goal of Video2SRT is to make a universal open source private tool for transcribing all video and audio files. The current project is built with OpenAI’s whisper model

This project is built with Svelte and uses WebAssembly along with GGerganov’s Whisper’s CPP bindings and FFMPEG.WASM for behind the scenes processing to develop the transcriptions

# Installation
